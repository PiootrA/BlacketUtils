# Blacket Router Util

You may be wondering exactly what this project is? It is a tampermonkey script that runs in the background as you are playing [the game](https://blacket.org) which **decreases** loading times while playing. It is a very useful **third-party** *(This was created by me, Piotr, not a developer for the game)* application to make the game more enjoyable. 

## Requirements

|          Name      | Download Link                        |
|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|Tampermonkey      | [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)
Blacket Router Utils Script           |[Script](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/478962-blacket-router-util)            |

There is not a lot to download for this third-party application to work, all you need is a device that is capable of running the game.

**This is only a router to increase the speed of Blacket aswell as a dark theme built in. This does not offer any hacks as of now, and is a third-party plugin that does not provide an in-game advantage over people that do not use scripts. It is still very useful!**
